"Bridging the gap between theory, experiment, and computation."

Who I am: I'm Luke. 

Where I work: I'm currently working as a Mathematician for a gaming company who makes slot-machines. 

What I studied: I studied Mathematics in undergrad and am finishing my masters degree in Materials Science & Engineering. 

What I do: My interests are interdisciplinary in nature: I do not consider myself exclusively a Mathematician, Scientist, nor Engineer -- but rather all three. 

Why I'm here: I love using computation to solve real life problems, at work and in everyday life!
